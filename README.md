## Overview
The Smart ATS project leverages the advanced capabilities of Google Gemini to revolutionize the candidate screening and selection process. This system is specifically designed to assist employers and HR professionals in tech industries, including software engineering, data science, data analysis, and big data engineering fields.

## Features
- *Automated Resume Matching:* Utilizes Google Gemini's generative AI to evaluate resumes against job descriptions, providing a percentage match that signifies the compatibility between the candidateâ€™s profile and the job requirements.
- *Keyword Highlighting:* Identifies and highlights critical keywords missing from a candidate's resume, allowing for a more thorough and precise assessment.
- *Efficiency and Precision:* Streamlines the candidate selection process by automating the initial screening, thus saving time and increasing the accuracy of candidate shortlisting.

## Technology Stack
- *Google GenerativeAI (Gemini):* At the core of our system, providing advanced algorithms for content generation and analysis.
